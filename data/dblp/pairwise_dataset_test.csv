4056,Verifiable Distributed Oblivious Transfer and Mobile Agent Security,"The mobile agent is a fundamental building block of the mobile computing paradigm. In mobile agent security, oblivious transfer (OT) from a trusted party can be used to protect the agent’s privacy and the hosts’ privacy. In this paper, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive called Verifiable Distributed Oblivious Transfer (VDOT), which allows us to replace a single trusted party with a group of threshold trusted servers. The design of VDOT uses a novel technique called consistency verification of encrypted secret shares. VDOT protects the privacy of both the sender and the receiver against malicious attacks of the servers. We also show the design of a system to apply VDOT to protect the privacy of mobile agents. Our design partitions an agent into the general portion and the security-sensitive portion. We also implement the key components of our system. As far as we know, this is the first effort to implement a system that protects the privacy of mobile agents. Our preliminary evaluation shows that protecting mobile agents not only is possible, but also can be implemented efficiently.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.2,Networks:0.2,Software and its engineering:0.3,Theory of computation:0.2,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.9,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.2,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is highly relevant for the cryptographic protocol (VDOT) and mobile agent security.

1386,New Notions of Soundness and Simultaneous Resettability in the Public-Key Model,"In this paper, some new notions of soundness in public-key model are presented. We clarify the relationships among our new notions of soundness and the original 4 soundness notions presented by Micali and Reyzin. Our new soundness notions also characterize a new model for ZK protocols in public key model: weak soundness model. By ``weak” we mean for each common input x selected by a malicious prover on the fly, x is used by the malicious prover at most a-priori bounded polynomial times. The weak soundness model just lies in between BPK model and UPK model. Namely, it is weaker than BPK model but stronger than UPK model. In the weak soundness model (also in the UPK model, since weak soundness model implies UPK model), we get a 3-round black-box rZK arguments with weak resettable soundness for NP. Note that simultaneous resettability is an important open problem in the field of ZK protocols. And Reyzin has proven that there are no ZK protocols with resettable soundness in the BPK model. It means that to achieve simultaneous resettability one needs to augment the BPK model in a reasonable fashion. Although Barak et al. [BGGL01] have proven that any language which has a black-box ZK arguments with resettable soundness is in BPP. It is the weak soundness that makes us to get simultaneous resettability. More interestingly, our protocols work in a somewhat ``parallel repetition” manner to reduce the error probability and the verifier indeed has secret information with respect to historical transcripts. Note that in general the error probability of such protocols can not be reduced by parallel repetition. [BIN97] At last, we give a 3-round non-black-box rZK arguments system with resettable soundness for NP in the preprocessing model in which a trusted third party is assumed. Our construction for such protocol is quite simple. Note that although the preprocessing model is quite imposing but it is still quite reasonable as indicated in [CGGM00]. For example, in many e-commerce setting a trusted third party is often assumed. The critical tools used in this paper are: verifiable pseudorandom functions, zap and complexity leveraging. To our knowledge, our protocols are also the second application of verifiable pseudorandom functions. The first application is the 3round rZK arguments with one-time soundness for NP in the public-key model as indicated by Micali and Reyzin [MR01a].","General and reference:0.0,Hardware:0.0,Computer systems organization:0.0,Networks:0.0,Software and its engineering:0.0,Theory of computation:0.0,Mathematics of computing:0.0,Information systems:0.0,Security and privacy:1.0,Human-centered computing:0.0,Computing methodologies:0.0,Applied computing:0.0,Social and professional topics:0.0",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is highly relevant because the paper introduces new cryptographic concepts (soundness and resettability) in zero-knowledge protocols.

2569,Blind 3D Video Watermarking Based on 3D-HEVC Encoder Using Depth,"Due to enormous advancement of internet technology and display devices, 3D video becomes popular in recent times. To ensure secure media transmission, efficient authentication scheme for such 3D video sequence is a requirement. In recent past, watermarking is being regarded as a popular DRM tool for video authentication. It has been observed that video watermarking becomes a challenging task in the presence of advanced auto-stereoscopic display devices and MVD (Multi-view Video plus Depth) based encoding technique in case of 3D video. In this paper, depth image based rendering technique is proposed for blind 3D video watermarking. In this scheme, rendering technique is used to find the Z-axis of the stereo videos (left and right video). The connected regions of the Z-axis of a Group of Picture (GOP) have been filtered using the motion prediction of the video. Block DCT coefficients are used to embed the watermark signal with the selected Z-axis regions of the each video (left and right separately). A comprehensive set of experiments have been done to justify the robustness of the proposed scheme over existing schemes with respect to compression of the 3D-HEVC video codec.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.2,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.2,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:1.0,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.3,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,"Security and privacy is highly relevant as the paper introduces a 3D video watermarking technique for secure transmission.

5778,"Keeping Authorities Honest or Bust with Decentralized Witness Cosigning""","The secret keys of critical network authorities -- such as time, name, certificate, and software update services -- represent high-value targets for hackers, criminals, and spy agencies wishing to use these keys secretly to compromise other hosts. To protect authorities and their clients proactively from undetected exploits and misuse, we introduce CoSi, a scalable witness cosigning protocol ensuring that every authoritative statement is validated and publicly logged by a diverse group of witnesses before any client will accept it. A statement S collectively signed by W witnesses assures clients that S has been seen, and not immediately found erroneous, by those W observers. Even if S is compromised in a fashion not readily detectable by the witnesses, CoSi still guarantees S's exposure to public scrutiny, forcing secrecy-minded attackers to risk that the compromise will soon be detected by one of the W witnesses. Because clients can verify collective signatures efficiently without communication, CoSi protects clients' privacy, and offers the first transparency mechanism effective against persistent man-in-the-middle attackers who control a victim's Internet access, the authority's secret key, and several witnesses' secret keys. CoSi builds on existing cryptographic multisignature methods, scaling them to support thousands of witnesses via signature aggregation over efficient communication trees. A working prototype demonstrates CoSi in the context of timestamping and logging authorities, enabling groups of over 8,000 distributed witnesses to cosign authoritative statements in under two seconds.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.2,Networks:0.3,Software and its engineering:0.2,Theory of computation:0.2,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.9,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.2,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,Security and privacy: The paper presents a cryptographic protocol (CoSi) for protecting network authorities against key compromise attacks.

429,Security in Outsourcing of Association Rule Mining,"Outsourcing association rule mining to an outside service provider brings several important benefits to the data owner. These include (i) relief from the high mining cost, (ii) minimization of demands in resources, and (iii) effective centralized mining for multiple distributed owners. On the other hand, security is an issue; the service provider should be prevented from accessing the actual data since (i) the data may be associated with private information, (ii) the frequency analysis is meant to be used solely by the owner. This paper proposes substitution cipher techniques in the encryption of transactional data for outsourcing association rule mining. After identifying the non-trivial threats to a straightforward one-to-one item mapping substitution cipher, we propose a more secure encryption scheme based on a one-to-n item mapping that transforms transactions non-deterministically, yet guarantees correct decryption. We develop an effective and efficient encryption algorithm based on this method. Our algorithm performs a single pass over the database and thus is suitable for applications in which data owners send streams of transactions to the service provider. A comprehensive cryptanalysis study is carried out. The results show that our technique is highly secure with a low data transformation cost.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.9,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is directly relevant as the paper focuses on cryptographic techniques to protect data during outsourcing.

1441,Secret sharing on trees: problem solved,"We determine the worst case information rate for all secret sharing schemes based on trees. It is the inverse of 2 − 1/c, where c is the size of the maximal core in the tree. A core is a connected subset of the vertices so that every vertex in the core has a neighbor outside the core. The upper bound comes from an application of the entropy method [2, 3], while the lower bound is achieved by a construction using Stinson’s decomposition theorem [7]. It is shown that 2 − 1/c is also the fractional cover number of the tree where the edges of the tree are covered by stars, and the vertex cover should be minimized, cf [5]. We also give an O(n) algorithm which finds an optimal cover on any tree, and thus a perfect secret sharing scheme with optimal rate.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.3,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:1.0,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,"Security and privacy: The paper presents a novel secret sharing scheme for trees, a core cryptographic problem.

1025,The design and implementation of a secure CAPTCHA against man-in-the-middle attacks,"In this paper, we propose a novel security protocol for the implementation of CAPTCHA tests that feature advance mechanisms against man-in-the-middle MITM, for short attacks. This type of attack is fulfilled by a malicious entity, the MITM, that leverages on unaware users to mass-solve CAPTCHA tests shielding the access to a service. The protocol that we propose uses collision-resistant hash functions modeled as random oracles to guarantee that the solution to a CAPTCHA test solved by an end user is valid only for the server to which the user is connected to. This will prevent MITM attacks because the user is not directly connected to the server. We developed a reference implementation for our protocol that has a low impact and is easy to use, featuring a software plug-in running in the Firefox web browser, on the client side, and a Java servlet-based application, on the server side.

5441,SMM-Based Hypervisor Integrity Measurement,"Hypervisors play an important role in the virtualised environment and consequently are a prime target for attacks. Different kinds of attacks have been reported and a great deal of research has been done to address vulnerabilities in hypervisors. Recently, after successful defeat of integrity measurement tools, a new class of measurement tools have been developed capitalising on the SMM to measure the integrity of hypervisors and other system components. Although those new tools are successful in their tasks, they do not take full advantage of the main benefits of SMM: isolation and stealth. We argue that this is due to the architecture those tools employ. Thus, in this paper, we establish a set of requirements and propose a generic architecture to build and deploy an SMM-based hypervisor integrity measurement tool.

4176,Performance Improvements and a Baseline Parameter Generation Algorithm for NTRUSign,"The NTRUSign signature scheme was introduced in [8]. The original presentation gave a theoretical description of the scheme and an analysis of its security, along with several parameter choices which claimed to yield an 80 bit security level. The paper [8] did not give a general recipe for generating parameter sets to a specific level of security. In line with recent research on NTRUEncrypt [9], this paper presents an outline of such a recipe for NTRUSign. NTRUSign has many more implementation options than NTRUEncrypt, and research is ongoing to improve the efficiency of NTRUSign operations at a given security level. This paper is therefore not intended to be the last word on parameter generation for NTRUSign, but to provide a specific parameter generation algorithm whose output has, we believe, the stated security properties. We also present certain technical advances upon which we intend to build in subsequent papers.

6011,An operating system security method for integrity and privacy protection in consumer electronics,"Linux is an open source operating system that is rapidly gaining popularity in consumer electronic devices. It has started being deployed in mobile phones and digital audio and video devices. However, with its success in the market, there is a greater need for security. The traditional Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model does not provide adequate security support. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) models can provide additional security in addition to the DAC scheme. However, some of the existing MAC schemes are too complex to be used in embedded devices, while others are simple yet do not provide fine-grained access control. In this paper, we present a MAC model that grants subjects permissions based on their past behavior. It is simple but it also provides a fine-grained access control to the operating system. With its small footprint, it can be applied to various systems, including embedded devices.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.2,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.2,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:1.0,Human-centered computing:0.2,Computing methodologies:0.3,Applied computing:0.2,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is highly relevant as the paper focuses on operating system security mechanisms like MAC and DAC.

2147,User-level secure deletion on log-structured file systems,"Deleting a file from a storage medium serves two purposes: it reclaims storage resources and ensures that any sensitive information contained in the file becomes inaccessible. When done for the latter purpose, it is critical that the file is securely deleted, meaning that its content does not persist on the storage medium after deletion. Secure deletion is the act of deleting data from a storage medium such that the data is afterwards irrecoverable from the storage medium. The time between deleting data and it becoming irrecoverable is called the deletion latency.","General and reference:0.0,Hardware:0.0,Computer systems organization:0.0,Networks:0.0,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.0,Mathematics of computing:0.0,Information systems:0.0,Security and privacy:1.0,Human-centered computing:0.0,Computing methodologies:0.0,Applied computing:0.0,Social and professional topics:0.0",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is highly relevant because the paper addresses secure deletion mechanisms to prevent data recovery.

253,Privacy Challenges in Third-Party Location Services,"The concern for location privacy in mobile applications is commonly motivated by a scenario in which a mobile device communicates personal location data, i.e. the device holder location, to a third party e.g. LBS provider, in exchange for some information service. We argue that this scenario offers a partial view of the actual risks for privacy, because in reality the information How can be more complex. For example, more and more often location is computed by a third party, the location provider, e.g. Google Location Service. Location providers are in the position of collecting huge amounts of location data from the users of diverse applications (e.g. Facebook and Foursquare to cite a few). This raises novel privacy concerns. In this paper, we discuss two issues related to the protection from location providers. The first focuses on the compliance of emerging location services standards with European data protection norms; the latter focuses on hard privacy solutions protecting from untrusted location providers.","General and reference:0.05,Hardware:0.05,Computer systems organization:0.05,Networks:0.05,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.05,Mathematics of computing:0.05,Information systems:0.15,Security and privacy:0.9,Human-centered computing:0.05,Computing methodologies:0.2,Applied computing:0.05,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is highly relevant as the paper focuses on location privacy risks and solutions for third-party services.

1565,ANASTASIA: ANdroid mAlware detection using STatic analySIs of Applications,"The number of malware applications targeting the Android operating system has significantly increased in recent years. Malicious applications pose a significant threat to Android platform security. We propose ANASTASIA, a system to detect malicious Android applications through statically analyzing applications' behaviors. ANASTASIA provides a more complete coverage of security behaviors when compared to state-of-the-art solutions. We utilize a large number of statically extracted features from various security behavioral characteristics of an application. We built a Machine Learning-based detection framework with high performance detection and acceptable false positive rate. The significance of our work is to develop a lightweight malware detection system for Android-powered smartphones that leverages robust, effective, and efficient features. Besides, in order to assess our solution, we used a reliable, large-scale, and updated malware data-set in terms of diversity and number of malware applications. We evaluated the performance of our proposal on large-scale malware data-set (including 18,677 malware and 11,187 benign apps).

1518,Enhancing the Scalability and Memory Usage of Hashsieve on Multi-core CPUs,"The Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) is a key problem in lattice-based cryptography and cryptanalysis. While the cryptography community has accumulated a vast knowledge of SVP-solvers from a theoretical standpoint, the practical performance of these algorithms is commonly not well understood. This gap in knowledge poses many challenges to cryptographers, who are oftentimes confronted with algorithms that perform worse in practice then expected from theory. This is a problem because the asymptotic complexity of the best algorithms plays a key role in the construction of cryptosystems, but only practically appealing, validated algorithms are accounted for in this process. Thus, if one cannot extract the full potential of theoretically strong algorithms in practice, efficient algorithms might be ruled out and wrong assumptions are made when constructing cryptosystems. In this paper, we take a step forward to fill this gap, by providing a computational analysis of HashSieve, the most practical sieving SVP-solver to date, and showing how its performance can be enhanced in practice. To this end, we revisit the parallel generation of random numbers, memory allocation and memory access patterns. Employing scalable random sampling, object memory pools, scalable memory allocators and aggressive memory prefetching, we were able to improve the best current implementation of HashSieve by factors of 3x and 4x, depending on the lattice dimension, and set new records for the HashSieve algorithm, thereby shrinking the gap between its theoretical complexity and its performance in practice.","General and reference:0.0,Hardware:0.2,Computer systems organization:0.2,Networks:0.0,Software and its engineering:0.0,Theory of computation:0.0,Mathematics of computing:0.2,Information systems:0.0,Security and privacy:0.9,Human-centered computing:0.0,Computing methodologies:0.0,Applied computing:0.0,Social and professional topics:0.0",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is central to the cryptographic SVP-solving work.

776,Protecting Web Browser Extensions from JavaScript Injection Attacks,"Vulnerable web browser extensions can be used by an attacker to steal users' credentials and lure users into leaking sensitive information to unauthorized parties. Current browser security models and existing JavaScript security solutions are inadequate for preventing JavaScript injection attacks that can exploit such vulnerable extensions. In this paper, we present a runtime protection mechanism based on a code randomization technique coupled with a static analysis technique to protect browser extensions from JavaScript injection attacks. The protection is enforced at runtime by distinguishing malicious code from the randomized extension code. We implemented our protection mechanism for the Mozilla Firefox browser and evaluated it on a set of vulnerable and non-vulnerable Firefox extensions. The evaluation results indicate that our approach can be a viable solution for preventing attacks on JavaScript-based browser extensions. In designing and implementing our approach, we were also able to reduce false positives and achieve maximum backward compatibility with existing extensions.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.95,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is highly relevant as the paper addresses JavaScript injection attack protection for web browser extensions.

1493,Privacy Shielding by Design — A Strategies Case for Near-Compliance,"Changes to the EU-US agreements on transatlantic data transmission are accepted. With the updates leading to an adequacy decision for the Privacy Shield, the European Commission further advances US adherence to the General Data Protection Regulation. The regulation comes with increasing territorial scope for the processing of personal data of persons in the EU, and includes the risk of substantial fines. Soon, a Privacy Shield self-certification will be necessary for US organizations which process EU data. Compliance with these requirements may be assisted by privacy by design.

3586,Generic Danger Detection for Mission Continuity,"Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) have become the environment of choice for providing edge connectivity to mobile forces. In particular, next-generation military systems leverage MANET technology to provide information assets to troops. However, MANETs face a number of serious security exposures, which are a superset of traditional networks. In prior work, we have described BITSI, the Biologically-Inspired Tactical Security Infrastructure, which attempts to address these challenges. BITSI uses a variety of techniques inspired by biological systems to provide effect-based security that is centered upon mission enablement. One of these techniques is the application of Danger Theory to mission continuity. In this paper, we explore different ways of implementing danger detection within BITSI, and show how generic approaches that are low-cost both computationally and in terms of implementation can provide acceptable results.","General and reference:0.0,Hardware:0.0,Computer systems organization:0.0,Networks:0.2,Software and its engineering:0.0,Theory of computation:0.0,Mathematics of computing:0.0,Information systems:0.0,Security and privacy:1.0,Human-centered computing:0.0,Computing methodologies:0.0,Applied computing:0.0,Social and professional topics:0.0",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is directly relevant as the paper addresses security in MANETs using danger theory.

Heinzelman et al. proposed a clustering method called LEACH which rotates the role of CH among the nodes in the network. However, it does not provide any security. In this paper, we propose two deterministic key establishment protocols to counter the vulnerabilities of LEACH protocol. These protocols are called polynomial-based key establishment protocol PBKEP and hash-based key establishment protocol HBKEP. These protocols ensure that it is always possible to establish a secret key with the current CH in every round of LEACH clustering protocol. The protocols also ensure that a malicious node cannot join the cluster at any round. The clusters are formed only among the legitimate nodes. Also any malicious node pretending as CH will not succeed as no other legitimate node will choose that as CH.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.95,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is highly relevant as the paper introduces cryptographic key establishment protocols for sensor networks.

1850,Location sharing privacy preference: analysis and personalized recommendation,"Location-based systems are becoming more popular with the explosive growth in popularity of smart phones. However, the user adoption of these systems is hindered by growing user concerns about privacy. To design better location-based systems that attract more user adoption and protect users from information under/overexposure, it is highly desirable to understand users' location sharing and privacy preferences. This paper makes two main contributions. First, by studying users' location sharing privacy preferences with three groups of people (i.e., Family, Friend and Colleague) in different contexts, including check-in time, companion and emotion, we reveal that location sharing behaviors are highly dynamic, context-aware, audience-aware and personal. In particular, we find that emotion and companion are good contextual predictors of privacy preferences. Moreover, we find that there are strong similarities or correlations among contexts and groups. Our second contribution is to show, in light of the user study, that despite the dynamic and context-dependent nature of location sharing, it is still possible to predict a user's in-situ sharing preference in various contexts. More specifically, we explore whether it is possible to give users a personalized recommendation of the sharing setting they are most likely to prefer, based on context similarity, group correlation and collective check-in preference.

4599,DEcryption Contract ENforcement Tool (DECENT): A Practical Alternative to Government Decryption Backdoors,A cryptographic contract and enforcement technology would guarantee release of a data decryption key to an authorized party if and only if predetermined contract requirements are satisfied. Threshold secret sharing can be used to eliminate the need for access to the hidden key under normal circumstances. It can also eliminate the liability and burden normally carried by device manufacturers or service providers when they store the decryption keys of their customers. Blockchain technology provides a mechanism for a public audit trail of the creation and release of the hidden key.

405,An introduction to multilevel secure relational database management systems,"Multilevel Security (MLS) is a capability that allows information with different classifications to be available in an information system, with users having different security clearances and authorizations, while preventing users from accessing information for which they are not cleared or authorized. It is a security policy that has grown out of research and development efforts funded mostly by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to address some of the drawbacks of the single level mode of operation that was used at the DoD. The goal was to build and deploy an MLS-compliant environment (e.g., Networks, Operating Systems, Database Systems) that would provide a much needed efficiency in processing and distributing classified information by providing security through computer security, communications security, and trusted system techniques instead of using physical controls, administrative procedures, and personnel security. As Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) are at the heart of the DoD's information system, significant research and development efforts have been put into building multilevel secure RDBMS, which have led to the emergence of a number of multilevel secure RDBMS solutions, including commercial ones. Over the past few years and with the increase of security concerns, MLS compliance has become a major requirement from a number U.S. Federal Government agencies that appear to have grown beyond the traditional agencies that require such type and level of security. This paper introduces MLS, and outlines the challenges and complexities of building a multilevel secure RDBMS. The paper also gives concrete examples of both research and commercial multilevel secure RDBMS and describes how they met the above challenges and complexities.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.3,Security and privacy:1.0,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,"Security and privacy is highly relevant because the paper introduces multilevel security (MLS) for relational databases, a core security policy.

814,Tracking based product authentication: Catching intruders in the supply chain,"Product counterfeiting is a growing problem worldwide, threatening the health of consumers and reducing company profits. By detecting and intercepting counterfeits before they reach the customer, the problem can be mitigated. In this paper, an approach to detect counterfeit items based on their claimed history is presented. The necessary data is provided by tracking infrastructures that enable the recording and retrieval of movements of individual items in the supply chain based on unique identifiers assigned to products. If the movement history of an item deviates from the movements of genuine items that have been learned before, a warning about a potential counterfeit is issued. Counterfeiter activities that are possible in a tracking enabled environment are modelled and the capability of the proposed approach to detect these strategies is assessed.","General and reference:0.0,Hardware:0.0,Computer systems organization:0.0,Networks:0.0,Software and its engineering:0.0,Theory of computation:0.0,Mathematics of computing:0.0,Information systems:0.0,Security and privacy:1.0,Human-centered computing:0.0,Computing methodologies:0.0,Applied computing:0.5,Social and professional topics:0.0",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is highly relevant as the paper addresses product authentication and counterfeit detection in supply chains.

2937,Canal: scaling social network-based Sybil tolerance schemes,"There has been a flurry of research on leveraging social networks to defend against multiple identity, or Sybil, attacks. A series of recent works does not try to explicitly identify Sybil identities and, instead, bounds the impact that Sybil identities can have. We call these approaches Sybil tolerance; they have shown to be effective in applications including reputation systems, spam protection, online auctions, and content rating systems. All of these approaches use a social network as a credit network, rendering multiple identities ineffective to an attacker without a commensurate increase in social links to honest users (which are assumed to be hard to obtain). Unfortunately, a hurdle to practical adoption is that Sybil tolerance relies on computationally expensive network analysis, thereby limiting widespread deployment.
 To address this problem, we first demonstrate that despite their differences, all proposed Sybil tolerance systems work by conducting payments over credit networks. These payments require max flow computations on a social network graph, and lead to poor scalability. We then present Canal, a system that uses landmark routing-based techniques to efficiently approximate credit payments over large networks. Through an evaluation on real-world data, we show that Canal provides up to a three-order-of-magnitude speedup while maintaining safety and accuracy, even when applied to social networks with millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of edges. Finally, we demonstrate that Canal can be easily plugged into existing Sybil tolerance schemes, enabling them to be deployed in an online fashion in real-world systems.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.2,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.9,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.2,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,"Security and privacy is directly relevant as the paper addresses Sybil attacks in social networks, presenting the Canal system for secure credit network analysis.

3486,Protection scheme for secure MPEG-2 streaming,"In this paper, we propose a protection scheme for MPEG-2 streaming media. To protect MPEG-2 media more effectively and securely, an encryption process should be considered on encoding phase of uncompressed stream and also a streaming server should be designed to support the protection scheme. However this way cannot support existing streaming systems and requires pre-processing such as demultiplexing and decoding. Our approach is to design a protection scheme independent to the streaming server. So, we propose an encryption method which can be applied to compressed MPEG-2 transport stream (TS). Proposed scheme can protect attacks over networks since streaming server streams pre-encrypted content and enables the client to decrypt the streamed data and playback in real time.

5132,Hulk: Eliciting Malicious Behavior in Browser Extensions,"We present Hulk, a dynamic analysis system that detects malicious behavior in browser extensions by monitoring their execution and corresponding network activity. Hulk elicits malicious behavior in extensions in two ways. First, Hulk leverages HoneyPages, which are dynamic pages that adapt to an extension's expectations in web page structure and content. Second, Hulk employs a fuzzer to drive the numerous event handlers that modern extensions heavily rely upon. We analyzed 48K extensions from the Chrome Web store, driving each with over 1M URLs. We identify a number of malicious extensions, including one with 5.5 million affected users, stressing the risks that extensions pose for today's web security ecosystem, and the need to further strengthen browser security to protect user data and privacy.","General and reference:0.2,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.3,Software and its engineering:0.5,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:1.0,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is highly relevant as the paper focuses on detecting malicious browser extensions and web security risks.

5608,Security analysis of a NTRU-based mutual authentication scheme,"NFC-based mobile transaction has come into limelight in recent years thanks to the rapid development of NFC and mobile technologies. In these applications, the NFC-chip is in the card emulation mode to simulate a credit card. Because many sensitive information is exchanged during the communication of the mobile transaction, mutual authentication is required in order to verify the legality of each communicating party. Recently, Part and Lee introduced an anonymous authentication scheme based on NTRU. It is aimed to protect user information in NFC mobile payment systems without directly using private financial information of users. However, we found a security flaw in their new scheme. In this paper, we show that their scheme is insecure against an eavesdropping attack. An attacker, without any secret information, can impersonate the user against a service provider and pass the authentication procedure. This may result in a serious problem in which an attacker can enjoy a service such as an on-line shopping on behalf of the real user without the permission of the real user. An improved scheme will be left as our future work.","General and reference:0.05,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.05,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.05,Theory of computation:0.05,Mathematics of computing:0.05,Information systems:0.05,Security and privacy:0.9,Human-centered computing:0.05,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.05,Social and professional topics:0.05",Security and privacy,Security and privacy: Analyzes a vulnerability in an NTRU-based authentication scheme.

2023,CloudFilter: practical control of sensitive data propagation to the cloud,"A major obstacle for the adoption of cloud services in enterprises is the potential loss of control over sensitive data. Companies often have to safeguard a subset of their data because it is crucial to their business or they are required to do so by law. In contrast, cloud service providers handle enterprise data without providing guarantees and may put confidentiality at risk. In order to maintain control over their sensitive data, companies typically block all access to a wide range of cloud services at the network level. Such restrictions significantly reduce employee productivity while offering limited practical protection in the presence of malicious employees.
 In this paper, we suggest a practical mechanism to ensure that an enterprise maintains control of its sensitive data while employees are allowed to use cloud services. We observe that most cloud services use HTTP as a transport protocol. Since HTTP offers well-defined methods to transfer files, inspecting HTTP messages allows the propagation of data between the enterprise and cloud services to be monitored independently of the implementation of specific cloud services. Our system, CloudFilter, intercepts file transfers to cloud services, performs logging and enforces data propagation policies. CloudFilter controls where files propagate after they have been uploaded to the cloud and ensures that only authorised users may gain access. We show that CloudFilter can be applied to control data propagation to Dropbox and GSS, describing the realistic data propagation policies that it can enforce.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.2,Software and its engineering:0.3,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.95,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,"Security and privacy: The paper addresses cloud data leakage prevention through access control and policy enforcement, which is directly within the domain of information security.

4816,Account Reachability: A Measure of Privacy Risk for Exposure of a User's Multiple SNS Accounts,"With the increased worldwide popularity of social networking services (SNSs), the leakage of a user's private information is becoming a serious problem. An increased number of users now have multiple accounts on various social networks and they tend to use each account to write different user experiments. Aggregating information from different accounts leads to the unintended leakage of personal information. Therefore, we argue that SNS users should be vigilant in protecting the relationship between multiple accounts.
 In this paper, we propose the use of Account Reachability, a measure of privacy risk which demonstrates the possibility of a stranger finding a user's private account based on information in their public account. In addition, we present ARChecker, a tool to calculate the value of account reachability. ARChecker also provides advice on how to modify the user's profiles and messages to decrease the privacy risk. By checking the privacy measure and modifying the profiles and messages of their SNS accounts, users can protect their multiple accounts from the risk of an unintended leakage of personal information.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.9,Human-centered computing:0.2,Computing methodologies:0.3,Applied computing:0.3,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is highly relevant as the paper addresses privacy risks in social networks.

2567,Modeling Attack Behaviors in Rating Systems,"Online feedback-based rating systems are gaining popularity. Dealing with unfair ratings in such systems has been recognized as an important problem and many unfair rating detection approaches have been developed. Currently, these approaches are evaluated against simple attack models, but complicated attacking strategies can be used by attackers in the real world. The lack of unfair rating data from real human users and realistic attack behavior models has become an obstacle toward developing reliable rating systems. To solve this problem, we design and launch a rating challenge to collect unfair rating data from real human users. In order to broaden the scope of the data collection, we also develop a comprehensive signal-based unfair rating detection system. Based on the analysis of real attack data, we discover important features in unfair ratings, build attack models, and develop an unfair rating generator. The models and generator developed in this paper can be directly used to evaluate current rating aggregation systems, as well as to assist the design of future rating systems.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.2,Software and its engineering:0.2,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:1.0,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.2,Applied computing:0.2,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is highly relevant as the paper addresses attack modeling in rating systems.

5950,Attribute-Based Access Control with Hidden Policies and Hidden Credentials,"In an open environment such as the Internet, the decision to collaborate with a stranger (e.g., by granting access to a resource) is often based on the characteristics (rather than the identity) of the requester, via digital credentials: access is granted if Alice's credentials satisfy Bob's access policy. The literature contains many scenarios in which it is desirable to carry out such trust negotiations in a privacy-preserving manner, i.e., so as minimize the disclosure of credentials and/or of access policies. Elegant solutions were proposed for achieving various degrees of privacy-preservation through minimal disclosure. In this paper, we present protocols that protect both sensitive credentials and sensitive policies. That is, Alice gets the resource only if she satisfies the policy, Bob does not learn anything about Alice's credentials (not even whether Alice got access), and Alice learns neither Bob's policy structure nor which credentials caused her to gain access.

We describe a comprehensive model of TOCTTOU vulnerabilities, enumerating 224 file system call pairs that may lead to successful TOCTTOU attacks. Based on this model, we built kernel monitoring tools that confirmed known vulnerabilities and discovered new ones (in often-used system utilities such as rpm, vi, and emacs). We evaluated the probability of successfully exploiting these newly discovered vulnerabilities and analyzed in detail the system events during such attacks. Our performance evaluation shows that the dynamic monitoring of system calls introduces non-negligible overhead in microbenchmark of those file system calls, but their impact on application benchmarks such as Andrew and PostMark is only a few percent.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.9,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is highly relevant as the paper focuses on TOCTTOU vulnerabilities in Unix systems.

1770,Analysis of network address shuffling as a moving target defense,"Address shuffling is a type of moving target defense that prevents an attacker from reliably contacting a system by periodically remapping network addresses. Although limited testing has demonstrated it to be effective, little research has been conducted to examine the theoretical limits of address shuffling. As a result, it is difficult to understand how effective shuffling is and under what circumstances it is a viable moving target defense. This paper introduces probabilistic models that can provide insight into the performance of address shuffling. These models quantify the probability of attacker success in terms of network size, quantity of addresses scanned, quantity of vulnerable systems, and the frequency of shuffling. Theoretical analysis shows that shuffling is an acceptable defense if there is a small population of vulnerable systems within a large network address space, however shuffling has a cost for legitimate users. These results will also be shown empirically using simulation and actual traffic traces.","General and reference:0.0,Hardware:0.0,Computer systems organization:0.0,Networks:0.0,Software and its engineering:0.0,Theory of computation:0.0,Mathematics of computing:0.5,Information systems:0.0,Security and privacy:1.0,Human-centered computing:0.0,Computing methodologies:0.0,Applied computing:0.0,Social and professional topics:0.0",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is highly relevant as the paper analyzes a moving target defense technique.

2330,On the concrete hardness of Learning with Errors,"Abstract The learning with errors (LWE) problem has become a central building block of modern cryptographic constructions. This work collects and presents hardness results for concrete instances of LWE. In particular, we discuss algorithms proposed in the literature and give the expected resources required to run them. We consider both generic instances of LWE as well as small secret variants. Since for several methods of solving LWE we require a lattice reduction step, we also review lattice reduction algorithms and use a refined model for estimating their running times. We also give concrete estimates for various families of LWE instances, provide a Sage module for computing these estimates and highlight gaps in the knowledge about algorithms for solving the LWE problem.","General and reference:0.0,Hardware:0.0,Computer systems organization:0.0,Networks:0.0,Software and its engineering:0.0,Theory of computation:0.5,Mathematics of computing:0.75,Information systems:0.0,Security and privacy:1.0,Human-centered computing:0.0,Computing methodologies:0.0,Applied computing:0.0,Social and professional topics:0.0",Security and privacy,"Security and privacy is highly relevant because the paper focuses on cryptographic hardness and LWE problems, which are fundamental to cryptographic security.

3888,Asymmetric fingerprinting for larger collusions,"Fingerprinting schemes deter people from illegally redistributing digital data by enabling the original merchant of the data to identify the original buyer of a redistributed copy. So-called traitor-tracing schemes have the same goal for keys that can be used to decrypt information that is broadcast in encrypted form. Recently, asymmetric fingerprinting and traitor-tracing schemes were introduced. Here, only the buyer knows the fingerprinted copy after a sale, and if the merchant finds this copy somewhere, he obtains a proof that he found the copy of this particular buyer. First constructions showed the validity of the concept. However, essentially all these constructions use so-called memory-less symmetric schemes as building blocks, whereas the better ones among the known symmetric schemes are not memory-less in this sense. Consequently, the previous asymmetric constructions did not reach the same level of tolerance against collusions as symmetric schemes. We now show asymmetric constructions without this restriction.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.2,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.9,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is highly relevant as the paper introduces asymmetric fingerprinting schemes to prevent traitor tracing and collusion attacks.

2039,Resistance analysis of scalable video fingerprinting systems under fair collusion attacks,"Digital fingerprinting is an important tool in multimedia forensics to trace traitors and protect multimedia content after decryption. This paper addresses the enforcement of digital rights when distributing multimedia over heterogeneous networks and studies the scalable multimedia fingerprinting systems in which users receive copies of different quality. We investigate the traitor tracing capability of such scalable fingerprinting systems, in particular, the robustness of the embedded fingerprints against multi-user collusion attacks. Under the fairness constraints on collusion that all attackers share the same risk of being captured, we analyze the maximum number of colluders that the fingerprinting systems can withstand, and our results show that multimedia fingerprints can survive collusion attacks by a few dozen colluders.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.2,Software and its engineering:0.2,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.3,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.9,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.2,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,"Security and privacy is highly relevant because the paper studies multimedia fingerprinting resistance to collusion attacks, a core security mechanism.

5066,A framework for empirical evaluation of malware detection resilience against behavior obfuscation,"Program obfuscation is increasingly popular among malware creators. Objectively comparing different malware detection approaches with respect to their resilience against obfuscation is challenging. To the best of our knowledge, there is no common empirical framework for evaluating the resilience of malware detection approaches w.r.t. behavior obfuscation. We propose and implement such a framework, called FEEBO that obfuscates the observable behavior of malware binaries targeting Microsoft Windows operating systems. To assess the framework's utility, we use it to obfuscate known malware binaries and then investigate the impact on detection effectiveness of different popular behavior based malware detection approaches. We find that the obfuscation transformations employed by FEEBO can affect the accuracy of such detection approaches significantly. FEEBO is therefore an effective and fair way to test the degree of resilience of behavior-based malware detection approaches against behavior obfuscation.","General and reference:0.0,Hardware:0.0,Computer systems organization:0.0,Networks:0.0,Software and its engineering:0.0,Theory of computation:0.0,Mathematics of computing:0.0,Information systems:0.0,Security and privacy:1.0,Human-centered computing:0.0,Computing methodologies:0.0,Applied computing:0.0,Social and professional topics:0.0",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is highly relevant as the paper evaluates malware detection resilience against obfuscation attacks.

These networked computers communicate and coordinate with similar machines and are controlled by Command and Control (C2). The use of botnet is on rise, growing day by day and a huge number of bot-masters are switching to HTTP-based C2 infrastructure, which allow them to blend in with benign web traffic. Fast-flux DNS is another way to make it tough to track down the control servers, because it may hop from DNS domain to DNS domain using domain generation algorithms. Botnets are becoming more serious problem on the internet due to its rapid evaluation and adoption of new strategies in their structure, protocols and attacks.

3011,Establishing Mutually Trusted Channels for Remote Sensing Devices with Trusted Execution Environments,"Remote and largely unattended sensing devices are being deployed rapidly in sensitive environments, such as healthcare, in the home, and on corporate premises. A major challenge, however, is trusting data from such devices to inform critical decision-making using standardised trust mechanisms. Previous attempts have focused heavily on Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) as a root of trust, but these forgo desirable features of recent developments, namely Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX and the GlobalPlatform TEE. In this paper, we contrast the application of TEEs in trusted sensing devices with TPMs, and raise the challenge of secure TEE-to-TEE communication between remote devices with mutual trust assurances. To this end, we present a novel secure and trusted channel protocol that performs mutual remote attestation in a single run for small-scale devices with TEEs. This is evaluated on two ARM development boards hosting GlobalPlatform-compliant TEEs, yielding approximately four-times overhead versus untrusted world TLS and SSH. Our work provides strong resilience to integrity and confidentiality attacks from untrusted world adversaries, facilitates TEE interoperability, and is subjected to mechanical formal analysis using Scyther.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.2,Computer systems organization:0.2,Networks:0.3,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:1.0,Human-centered computing:0.2,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.1",Security and privacy,Security and privacy is highly relevant as the paper focuses on secure TEE-to-TEE communication and mutual trust mechanisms.

584,The Increased Need For FCC Merger Review In A Networked World,"Recently, the FCC announced a new standard for review in mergers. Under the new standard, mass media mergers that comply with existing rules will automaticly receive approval, while those that do not will receive a more searching review. Common carrier mergers, however, will continue to receive the 4=part test established in Bell Atlantic/Nynex. The new standard fails to take into account the complexities of the emerging, converged networked world, and is essentially obsolete on arrival.

Considering company size and technology intensity as two of the most relevant contingent variables in terms of organizational conditions (Mintzberg, 1979), the moderator role of these variables will be examined. For these relationships to be tested, an empirical study has been carried out among Spanish manufacturing firms with more than 50 employees which carry out R&D activities. Structural equation modelling (SEM) based on partial least squares (PLS) has been applied in order to test the main hypotheses of the research. The results obtained show that organizational design and organizational culture play a substantial role when it comes to explaining the degree of success of implementation of people-focused knowledge sharing initiatives.

3266,Network Structure and Social Outcomes: Network Analysis for Social Science,"Human behavior is characterized by connections to others. We define ourselves by these connections: our families, our friends, our neighbors, our co-workers all form a social geography. Social scientists who study networks serve as cartographers for these social plains, identifying actors who influence others. In their overview of the study of political networks, McClurg and Young (2011) state, “We would probably all agree that one primary tie among political scientists is our emphasis on power, and understanding how and why power is used. We are all inherently interested in the exercise of power between and among individuals and groups and the implications that this exercise holds for social outcomes. We contend that this unifying concept is, at its very core, relational.” Social scientists have an interest in relational social science, with roles as either researchers directly focusing on relationships between actors or else as scholars accounting for interdependence among actors and institutions in their analyses. Additionally, we have seen an explosion in the availability of networked data. With the rise of social media, the relationships between ordinary citizens and political elites, among ordinary citizens, and even among political elites is more easily quantified. When once scholars of Congress had to “soak and poke” to understand a legislator’s relationship with her constituents (Fenno 1978), now it is possible to directly observe the connections that legislators establish with their constituents over Twitter, as well as the connections between the constituents themselves (Barbera 2015), the donations made to legislators and","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.1,Human-centered computing:0.2,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.9",Social and professional topics,"Social and professional topics: The paper discusses social network analysis and its implications for social outcomes, which aligns with social and professional topics.

3738,The Origins of Information Science and the International Institute of Bibliography/International Federation for Information and Documentation (FID),"This article suggests that the ideas and practices embraced by the term “documentation,” introduced by Paul Otlet and his colleagues to describe the work of the International Institute of Bibliography (later FID) that they set up in Brussels in 1895, constituted a new “discursive formation,” to echo Foucault. While today's special terminology of information science was not then in use, this should not obscure the fact that key concepts for information science as we now understand this field of study and research—and the technical systems and professional activities in which it is anchored—were implicit in and operationalized by what was created within the International Institute of Bibliography in 1895 and the decades that followed. The ideas and practices to be discussed would today be rubricated as information technology, information retrieval, search strategies, information centers, fee-based information services, linked data bases, database management software, scholarly communication networks, multimedia and hypertext, even the modern, diffuse notion of “information” itself. The article argues that important aspects of the origins of information science, as we now know it in the U.S. and elsewhere in the English-speaking world, were contained within or became an extension of the discursive formation that we have labeled “documentation.” — Author's Abstract","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.1,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.8",Social and professional topics,"Social and professional topics is highly relevant because the paper discusses the historical origins of information science as a discursive formation.

2186,Newsworthiness and Network Gatekeeping on Twitter: The Role of Social Deviance,"Publishers of news information are keen to amplify the reach of their content by making it as re-sharable as possible on social media. In this work we study the relationship between the concept of social deviance and the re-sharing of news headlines by network gatekeepers on Twitter. Do network gatekeepers have the same predilection for selecting socially deviant news items as professionals? Through a study of 8,000 news items across 8 major news outlets in the U.S. we predominately find that network gatekeepers re-share news items more often when they reference socially deviant events. At the same time we find and discuss exceptions for two outlets, suggesting a more complex picture where newsworthiness for networked gatekeepers may be moderated by other effects such as topicality or varying motivations and relationships with their audience.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.1,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:1.0",Social and professional topics,Social and professional topics is highly relevant for the study of social media behavior and gatekeeping.

5518,Creating a shared understanding of testing culture on a social coding site,"Many software development projects struggle with creating and communicating a testing culture that is appropriate for the project's needs. This may degrade software quality by leaving defects undiscovered. Previous research suggests that social coding sites such as GitHub provide a collaborative environment with a high degree of social transparency. This makes developers' actions and interactions more visible and traceable. We conducted interviews with 33 active users of GitHub to investigate how the increased transparency found on GitHub influences developers' testing behaviors. Subsequently, we validated our findings with an online questionnaire that was answered by 569 members of GitHub. We found several strategies that software developers and managers can use to positively influence the testing behavior in their projects. However, project owners on GitHub may not be aware of them. We report on the challenges and risks caused by this and suggest guidelines for promoting a sustainable testing culture in software development projects.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.2,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.1,Human-centered computing:0.3,Computing methodologies:0.2,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.8",Social and professional topics,Social and professional topics is highly relevant as the paper analyzes testing culture in software development communities.

1415,Digital India and Women: Bridging the Digital Gender Divide,"The purpose of this study is to find out whether digital technologies can reduce the existing gender inequality in Indian society. The current debate around digitalization is limited to the ones who have access and the ones who haven't. But this paper takes the debate beyond access by suggesting a three-tier framework for measuring the impact of digital technologies on women empowerment. The Digital India programme run by Government of India is taken as a case study by the authors. Rather than depending on traditional methodologies to bring gender equality, can we consider Digital India as a potential solution?

995,How to break an API: cost negotiation and community values in three software ecosystems,"Change introduces conflict into software ecosystems: breaking changes may ripple through the ecosystem and trigger rework for users of a package, but often developers can invest additional effort or accept opportunity costs to alleviate or delay downstream costs. We performed a multiple case study of three software ecosystems with different tooling and philosophies toward change, Eclipse, R/CRAN, and Node.js/npm, to understand how developers make decisions about change and change-related costs and what practices, tooling, and policies are used. We found that all three ecosystems differ substantially in their practices and expectations toward change and that those differences can be explained largely by different community values in each ecosystem. Our results illustrate that there is a large design space in how to build an ecosystem, its policies and its supporting infrastructure; and there is value in making community values and accepted tradeoffs explicit and transparent in order to resolve conflicts and negotiate change-related costs.","General and reference:0.0,Hardware:0.0,Computer systems organization:0.0,Networks:0.0,Software and its engineering:0.0,Theory of computation:0.0,Mathematics of computing:0.0,Information systems:0.0,Security and privacy:0.0,Human-centered computing:0.0,Computing methodologies:0.0,Applied computing:0.0,Social and professional topics:0.85",Social and professional topics,"Social and professional topics is relevant as the paper discusses community values and governance in software ecosystems.

2460,ICT pollution and liability,"To a large extent liability for ICT perils is still a grey area, even though an increasing number of information security researchers adopt economic approaches to highlight market mechanisms and externalities. That is why this article focuses on the need for increased awareness of externalities and liability among ICT professionals and their customers. This is critical to achieve in order to promote appropriate ICT technologies and services with comprehensible privacy and security protection.
 What is needed is a better understanding of the consequences of externalities from ICT perils. This would benefit customers and increase trust in ICT products and services which in turn may even increase suppliers' profit margin; customers would be prepared to buy more services and products if contracts and service level agreements would accept more liability. Moreover, suppliers could sell guaranties and insurances on top of their products and services.

It also relates to how the course improves information literacy., – Libraries in Poland can considerably strengthen their role as an element of the information and knowledge society by expanding their offers regarding internet access and e‐learning. The situation in Germany in 1999 was comparable with the current situation in Poland. As a reaction to this, the Bertelsmann Foundation initiated an online course offer comprising three modules: “BIBWEB – internet training for libraries” (see www.bibweb.de), which met with great acceptance in Germany. For this reason, it made sense to translate the existing successful course product and adapt it to the special requirements of libraries in Poland. The Bertelsmann Foundation and its two project partners, the Warsaw University Library and the “Elektroniczna Biblioteka” (EBIB) library information service, have jointly developed such a Polish‐language online course (see www.bibweb.pl) and have offered it on the internet to the specialist target group since 2003., – This paper shows the benefits of an international educational project.

1799,The regulation of online extreme pornography: purposive teleology (in)action,"The Internet has necessitated some changes in the way pornography is regulated. In the UK, there has been a demonstrable shift of focus in the regulation of the end user. The traditional regulatory model, focussing on the producer and distributor of content, has altered with the introduction of simple possession offences for pornography that makes the end user also liable for illegal content. This article analyses the issue by considering the general teleological reasoning for the regulation of pornography, and applies this to the legislation dealing with extreme adult pornography. The article points out that a sound teleological basis is imperative for pornography regulation, and that legislative action that overlooks this is fundamentally flawed and will ultimately fail in providing efficacious protection. The article argues that in order to restore confidence in the regulatory system there should be a coherent teleology behind the regulation of pornography, and also that the focus of legal regulation for extreme pornography should remain with producers and distributors rather than content recipients.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.1,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.9",Social and professional topics,Social and professional topics is highly relevant as the paper discusses legal and societal implications of pornography regulation.

1282,A Strategic Roadmap for Navigating Academic-Industry Collaborations in Information Systems Research: Avoiding Rigor Mortis,"Research collaboration between industry and academia remains challenging despite progress being made on a number of fronts. We are not implying that all information systems researchers should be engaging in industry collaborations, nor should the value of critique and work exclusively addressing academic and other audiences be viewed as less valuable than those engaging industry. The intent is instead to encourage more industry collaboration, and for those considering such initiatives to roadmap the activities strategically giving consideration to the full range of activities required so reasonable tradeoffs can be made in the context of building longer-term sustainable relationships.
 We develop a roadmap from literature that organizes the building blocks (component activities) needed to plan and implement strategic academic-industry collaborations over longer time horizons. Specifically, we identify the key themes or layers of (1) Strategic Business Problem(s), (2) Governance, (3) Funding Criteria, (4) Privacy, Security and Ethics, (5) Intellectual Property, (6) Research Design and (7) Recognized Outputs, which need to be in place if you are to succeed with academic-industry research.
 The roadmap framework highlights the need to consider the implications of the components across each of the layers at a particular point in time (vertical slice), the relationship between layers (dependencies) and the need for aligning the various activities in a coordinated manner; otherwise success at one layer is often undermined by a lack of awareness or failure at another layer.
 Our hope is that these themes (layers) facilitate organizing this collaboration in a systematic and coordinated manner to produce academic-industry collaborations that progressively improve over time.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.1,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.9",Social and professional topics,"Social and professional topics: The paper discusses strategic frameworks for academic-industry collaborations, a topic centered on professional and organizational practices.

3930,Who Gets Started on Kickstarter? Demographic Variations in Fundraising Success,"Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter are expected to “democratize” funding by increasing the availability of capital to traditionally underrepresented groups, but there is conflicting evidence about racial disparities in success rates. This paper contributes to the information systems literature on crowdfunding by examining the racial dynamics in the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. The race of subjects in project and user photos are determined with facial recognition software for 138,778 fundraising projects, and matched sample techniques are used to control for observable differences in project categories among racial groups. Even controlling for these observable differences, this study finds that projects with African-American photo subjects achieve lower success rates. African-American fundraisers also achieve significantly lower success than other groups, and this effect is larger than the effect from project photos. This study has practical implications for individuals seeking capital in these markets as well as design implications for the platforms themselves.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.3,Information systems:0.5,Security and privacy:0.1,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.2,Social and professional topics:0.9",Social and professional topics,"Social and professional topics: The study examines racial disparities in crowdfunding success, which is a social and professional issue.

3248,Implications Regarding Computer Technology Attitudes of New Employees,"Abstract Employee attitudes toward computer technology change over time. As computer technology becomes increasingly more prevalent throughout society and throughout the educational process, appreciative and critical attitudes toward the technology change.

5952,The management of high seas fisheries,"The intergovernmental United Nations Conference on Highly Migratory and Straddling Stocks, initiated in 1993 and finished in 1995, addressed the conservation and management of fishery resources located both within the coastal state 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the adjacent high seas. These types of marine resources continue to be a source for international conflicts and debates. The original United Nations Law of the Sea of 1982 failed to address transboundary fisheries in a proper way. In particular, the agreement did not recognize the emergence of the complicated “straddling stock” issue. In the new United Nations Law of the Sea agreement of 1995, a consensus was reached that the management of the straddling and highly migratory fish stocks should be carried out through regional fisheries management organizations. We present a review of the straddling stock issues in the international agreement emerging from the negotiations within the United Nations. The review is contrasted with and clarified by game theoretic analyses. We also discuss one international fishery exemplifying the case, the Norwegian spring‐spawning herring. The main conclusion is that the local problems, faced during the stage of setting up regional fisheries organizations for the management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks, are expected to be much more complicated and difficult to solve as compared to the cases of “shared fish stocks”. In the current paper, we present two reasons for this increased complexity. The first is the larger number of players as compared to the case of “shared fish stocks” and the second is the possibility of new members entering the regional fisheries organizations.","General and reference:0.0,Hardware:0.0,Computer systems organization:0.0,Networks:0.0,Software and its engineering:0.0,Theory of computation:0.0,Mathematics of computing:0.0,Information systems:0.0,Security and privacy:0.0,Human-centered computing:0.0,Computing methodologies:0.0,Applied computing:0.0,Social and professional topics:0.9",Social and professional topics,Social and professional topics is relevant due to international fisheries policy analysis.

1514,The Role of Relational Familiarity When Interpreting Family Business Communication,"Research problem: This study investigates the difference in perceptions within the family-owned businesses of messages received from family members and outsiders to assess the role that relational familiarity (the amount of prior experience two people share communicating with each other) plays in internal business communication in these settings. Previous research has shown that this relational familiarity-along with experience with the communicative medium, the message topic, and the business context-lead to channel expansion (the ability to reduce uncertainty from a message with limited communicative cues) for business communicators. But the impact of relational familiarity on communication competence and personal biases between family members-which could impact the ability of relational familiarity to achieve its intended goals-has yet to be fully explored. Research questions: (1) Does increased relational familiarity between communicators lead to increased perceptions of message effectiveness and appropriateness in lean media settings? (2) In family business settings where familial biases may be prevalent, is increased relational familiarity linked to perceptions of increased sender likeability and lowered message negativity? Literature review: Channel Expansion Theory, which proposes that communicators can overcome the limitations of a medium by using their personal experience, guides this study. Previous research found that with personal experience with the communicator sending the message, a message receiver can enhance the limited capacity of a medium to convey cues that aid in understanding the message. Four perceptual variables-message effectiveness, message appropriateness, message negativity, sender likeability-result in benefits accrued from channel expansion and relational familiarity, such as reduced uncertainty and equivocality about the message topic. Methodology: A quasiexperimental setting was designed to elicit messages from business co-workers using email. Message senders were instructed to describe the same business problem in order for the recipient to understand the problem and decide how to proceed. Eighty-three family business owners, managers, and employees received one message from a family member belonging to the same business and one message assigned at random from a nonfamily member working elsewhere (a stranger). The 83 message receivers were asked to complete instruments measuring their perceptions of the messages. Results and conclusions: Results suggested that the relational familiarity between communicators played a significant role in improving message effectiveness and message appropriateness. Sender likeability was also enhanced when family members correctly identified the source of the message. The findings suggest that family members can benefit from channel expansion, though not as many members as expected, and that complex problem and task descriptions were communicated using lean media (communication channels that inhibit sending messages infused with communicative cues) and are perceived as most effective when described by familiar others.","General and reference:0.0,Hardware:0.0,Computer systems organization:0.0,Networks:0.0,Software and its engineering:0.0,Theory of computation:0.0,Mathematics of computing:0.0,Information systems:0.0,Security and privacy:0.0,Human-centered computing:0.2,Computing methodologies:0.0,Applied computing:0.2,Social and professional topics:0.9",Social and professional topics,Social and professional topics align with the study of communication dynamics in family businesses.

4674,How Customer Participation can Drive Repurchase Intent,"The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of customer participation in the service delivery process by designing and testing an empirical model with the customers’ point of view in mind. Data are collected in the context of professional financial insurance services. The proposed model is analyzed with partial least squares (PLS) path modeling in SmartPLS 2.0 software. The results of the study show that customer participation produces positive effects on customer satisfaction and affective commitment through the customer relational value. Affective commitment is a strong predictor of repurchase intent, but no relationship between customer satisfaction and repurchase intent was found. This study suggests that customer participation can be a win-win situation for customers and the service firm. Customers who create relational value with their service providers effectively enjoy their services more and are more likely to build and maintain long-term relationships with their service firm. Our findings highlight the roles of the customer and indicate the heuristic value of viewing customer satisfaction and affective commitment as consequences of customer participation. This can enhance the understanding of how encounters should be designed in order to support employees and improve the co-creation of value.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.1,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.9",Social and professional topics,Social and professional topics is relevant for business/customer behavior analysis.

2015,Adaption-Innovation Theory and Cognitive Diversity: The Impact on Knowledge Use within Organizations,"The usefulness of data within organizations is proposed to be partially dependent upon the characteristics of those organization members who actually use it. Certain types of data are more likely to be accessed and utilized by organization members when they prefer working with it. The value and usefulness of data is therefore partially determined by the desire of individuals to use it. Because critical data may not be in a preferred format, it can be overlooked or ignored by some organizational members. Moreover, organizational members may also rely too heavily on their favored types of data. Thus, inappropriate access and use of data can occur within organizational decision making. This can result in ineffective decision-making and poor organizational performance. The purpose of this study is to propose relationships between the users of both tacit and explicit knowledge and their preferred cognitive style and to test these proposed relationships using empirical data.","General and reference:0.0,Hardware:0.0,Computer systems organization:0.0,Networks:0.0,Software and its engineering:0.0,Theory of computation:0.0,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.3,Security and privacy:0.0,Human-centered computing:0.0,Computing methodologies:0.0,Applied computing:0.0,Social and professional topics:0.6",Social and professional topics,Social and professional topics is the only relevant category as the paper discusses organizational decision-making and cognitive styles.

3055,Responder Feelings in a Three-Player Three-Option Ultimatum Game: Affective Determinants of Rejection Behavior,"This paper addresses the role of affect and emotions in shaping the behavior of responders in the ultimatum game. A huge amount of research shows that players do not behave in an economically rational way in the ultimatum game, and emotional mechanisms have been proposed as a possible explanation. In particular, feelings of fairness, anger and envy are likely candidates as affective determinants. We introduce a three-player ultimatum game with three-options, which permits the responder to either penalize the proposer or to penalize a third party by rejecting offers. This allows for partially distinguishing rejections due to a retaliation motive driven by anger towards the proposer from rejections due to inequity aversion driven by feelings of envy towards a third party. Results from two experiments suggest that responders experience feelings of dissatisfaction and unfairness if their share is small in comparison to the proposer’s share; anger, then, may trigger rejections towards the proposer. Responders also experience dissatisfaction and envy when third party shares exceed their own shares; however, in contrast to anger, envy does not trigger rejections and is dissociated from the decision to accept or reject an offer. We conclude that acting upon anger is socially acceptable, whereas envy is not acceptable as a reason for action. Furthermore, we find that responders generally feel better after rejections, suggesting that rejections serve to regulate one’s affective state.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.1,Human-centered computing:0.5,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:1.0",Social and professional topics,"Social and professional topics is highly relevant as the paper focuses on behavioral economics and social decision-making.

1087,Reading strategies and student comprehension in an Internet ethics course,"Our students' reading comprehension skills underpin their ability to learn the concepts and competencies in computer science. However, there has been little attention given to evaluating how well our students comprehend what they read and the effectiveness of strategies to improve their reading comprehension. In this paper we focus on the case of a non-major course on internet ethics and the reading of the original writings of key figures in ethical theory. Due to the observed weakness of the reading comprehension skills of the students, we have been teaching our students strategies to improve their skills in reading comprehension and meta-comprehension within the framework of an in-class group reading. The reading strategies we have been using are described, evaluated, and placed in the context of the reading comprehension literature. Increased awareness of the limitations of the reading comprehension skills of our students and of ways to teach the students strategies to improve those skills should prove useful in helping instructors ensure that our students have the foundation they need to be successful in their computer science studies.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.2,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.1,Human-centered computing:0.2,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.8",Social and professional topics,Social and professional topics: The paper discusses educational methods for computer science students.

1320,Persevere or Exit: What is the Right Strategy?,": The teaching case describes India’s telecommunications market as it went through a major transformation due to its adopting mobile telephony. The country’s huge market size and low teledensity have provided an attractive opportunity for foreign multinationals. Telenor entered the Indian market through a joint venture with Unitech Wireless under the brand name of Uninor and targeted the value-conscious segment of mobile customers with its attractive pricing schemes. After a few years of rapid growth, Uninor faced a huge business risk when the Supreme Court o f India ruled that its purchased spectrum was illegal. The case describes the aftermath of the 2G spectrum scam and how it adversely affected Uninor’s future. At this critical juncture, Telenor faced a strategic decision dilemma. Should it continue its operations in the ever-growing Indian mobile market or should it cut its losses and exit before receiving further damage to its global brand? This teaching case imparts important lessons about doing telecommunications-related business in an emerging economy with high returns and immense business risks.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.1,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.9",Social and professional topics,Social and professional topics is highly relevant as the paper is a business case study.

691,Using poetry as a teaching tool for the humanities to learn computer science concepts,"The emerging fields of digital humanities and humanities computing require new approaches in the area of their education by computer scientists. Currently, the role of educators in computer science has been to ready computer science students to obtain employment and research within the sciences, however, this must be changed if these two new fields are to be adequately served. We look at four areas where poetry can be used as an introduction to computer science: the analysis of poetry which uses the computer as its media, the analysis of concrete poems, the creation of poetry using a computer or using the computer as an aid to its creation, and professional development for instructors.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.1,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.9",Social and professional topics,Social and professional topics is relevant as the paper discusses educational approaches and interdisciplinary collaboration in digital humanities.

626,Effects of knowledge management on unit performance: examining the moderating role of tacitness and learnability,"Purpose 
 
 
 
 
This paper aims to examine and test the moderating influence of the type of knowledge underlying work – known as the knowledge in practice (KIP) perspective – on the relationship between knowledge management (KM) activities and unit performance. KIP proposes that the knowledge underlying work varies according to two dimensions: tacitness and learnability. This theory proposes that aligning KM activities with tacitness and learnability results in increased performance. However, to the authors’ knowledge, there exists no direct empirical tests of these propositions outlined in KIP theory. This study examines the empirical support for the theoretical predictions outlined by KIP. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
The study uses a multiple survey, multiple respondent survey design to measure KM activity sets, the tacitness and learnability involved in work contexts and unit performance. Regression analysis is used to test the hypotheses. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
In line with previous research, the authors find support for a direct relationship between some KM activity sets and unit performance. Surprisingly, the authors did not find support for the predictions offered by KIP theory. Specifically, the degree of tacitness or learnability did not moderate the relationship between KM activity sets and unit performance. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
The lack of findings to support the moderating effects of tacitness and learnability on the relationship between KM activity sets and unit performance challenges the adequacy of existing formulations of KIP theory. The authors discuss several important future research directions to examine this puzzling finding. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
This paper reinforces the suggestion that managers at all levels of organizations should engage in KM activities to increase performance. These findings also suggest that considering the type of knowledge underlying a unit’s work should not be a consideration in implementing KM activities. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
This is the first study to empirically test a KIP perspective. That is, how the type of knowledge involved in work moderates the relationships between KM activity sets and unit performance.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.1,Security and privacy:0.1,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.9",Social and professional topics,Social and professional topics is relevant for organizational knowledge management studies.

2738,The Effects of Network Diversity and Social Norms on Social Structuring: Empirical Evidence from Online Social Networks,"Behavior in social groups follows social norms defining what is acceptable and what is not. Prior research has found strong tendencies toward informational isomorphism in online social networks, as social peers seem to establish a shared understanding of what behavior is acceptable. Due to the additive nature of these social norms, individual' s social context gets more restrictive as network diversity increases. As a consequence, individuals organize their contacts into groups, which is referred to as social structuring behavior, to create a less restrictive environment and to avoid violating social norms. While drawing on diversity literature, this study examines the relationship between age, social embeddedness, and nationality diversity on social structuring behavior. For that, a matched dataset from Facebook is used. Findings support the important role social norms play in OSN, and that increases in social embeddedness lead to increases in structuring behavior. Implications for IS theory are discussed.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.1,Computer systems organization:0.1,Networks:0.1,Software and its engineering:0.1,Theory of computation:0.1,Mathematics of computing:0.1,Information systems:0.2,Security and privacy:0.1,Human-centered computing:0.2,Computing methodologies:0.1,Applied computing:0.1,Social and professional topics:0.9",Social and professional topics,Social and professional topics is relevant as the paper empirically studies social norms and structuring behavior in online networks.

5442,The Role of Body Image in the Relationship Between Internet Use and Bulimic Symptoms: Three Theoretical Frameworks,"Exposure to traditional media has been associated with bulimic symptoms. However, to date, little is known regarding the effects of Internet exposure. The aim of this study was to explore the relationships between Internet use and bulimic symptoms within the competing frameworks of sociocultural, impression management, and self-objectification theory. A sample of 289 French women aged 18-25 years completed an online questionnaire assessing bulimic symptoms, body dissatisfaction, body image avoidance, self-surveillance, body shame, and weekly Internet use. Bootstrapping analyses revealed that body shame and body image avoidance mediated the effect of weekly Internet use on bulimic symptoms. Furthermore, when entered into a multiple mediation analysis, these two variables provided independent mediation pathways of equal magnitude. The findings support the usefulness of both the self-objectification and impression management frameworks for investigating the relationship between Internet use and bulimic symptoms. Longitudinal research would help to clarify these pathways further.","General and reference:0.1,Hardware:0.05,Computer systems organization:0.05,Networks:0.05,Software and its engineering:0.05,Theory of computation:0.05,Mathematics of computing:0.05,Information systems:0.05,Security and privacy:0.05,Human-centered computing:0.1,Computing methodologies:0.05,Applied computing:0.15,Social and professional topics:0.2",Social and professional topics,"The paper analyzes the social and psychological impact of internet use on bulimic symptoms, which aligns with social and professional topics.
